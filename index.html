<p>
  Welcome!
</p>

<p>
  Soul of the ocean and stars, lover of stories and imaginary worlds, Oxford alumna, actress—that’s me. I love helping authors let their written words soar. Please take a moment to get a feeling for the way I work and if you feel we are a match, I look forward to hearing from you.
</p>

  ‘Mera was brilliant. Her attention to detail and rapid turnaround were superb; I will be using her services again in the future.’ —Steve B.-E.</em>
</p>

<p>
  My preferred genres are YA and NA, fantasy, romance, science fiction, spiritual, body-mind-spirit, personal growth, self-help, and theatre/film; though I am open to letting myself be surprised by and falling in love with any kind of work.

  I recognise that you do me a huge honour in allowing me to become a part of your creation process, so I like to edit in a serving, constructive, and contributive way whilst being clear, honest, and detailed.
</p>

<p>
  Have you ever read a book that was commercially successful thanks to the overwhelming pull of its story, yet the writing was subpar, and you wondered how breathtaking it could have been had it seen that extra care? I am fascinated with the power of story and am guided by the desire to do it justice. As the two big pillars in my life are editing and acting, my respect towards the story being told is particularly passionate.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, my experience in personal coaching supports my editing relationship with authors and if desired I enjoy being available to authors as a sounding board as much as in the more traditional editor role.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, being based between London and LA, I love entering into a working partnership with authors from either side of the pond... as well as anywhere else on this beautiful planet.
